# Purely functional programming

* designates a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions

* The Function inside the functional paradigm, will only depend on their arguments

## Properties of purely functional programming

1. Strict versus non-strict evaluation
ensures that the programmer does not have to consider in which order programs are evaluated, since eager evaluation will return the same result as lazy evaluation
2. Parallel computing
Purely functional programming simplifies parallel computing
since two purely functional parts of the evaluation never interact.
3. Data Structures

## Purely functional language

A purely functional language is a language which only admits purely functional programming. Purely functional programs can however be written in languages which are not purely functional.
