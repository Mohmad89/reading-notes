# Open-Source Software Contribution

*Most developers and companies depend on open-source tools and software to make their products work. And I think you'll agree with me that the number of contributions to open-source have really grown lately – not just for solo developers but from companies also.

## Why you Should Contribute to Open-Source

1. To improve the software you rely on daily.
2. To find a mentor if you need one.
3. To learn new skills or improve on existing ones.
4. To share your skills.
5. To gain a much deeper knowledge about the software

## How to Contribute to Open Source

* , it does not necesarilly mean that you need to know how to code. There are different ways in which you can contribute even if you are a non-coder – but having some coding skills will help you (and the projects) out a lot.

* Some common contributions can be through: 
    1. Adding a description to a project's documentation to elaborate on a certain point, mostly referred to as a README file 
    2. Giving guidance on a specific project and how to use it.
    3. Adding sample output to show how the code works.
    4. Writing in-depth tutorials for the project.
    5. Adding translation for a project
    6. Answering questions about a project
    7. You can offer to mentor another contributor.
    8. ou can fix typos and arrange the project's work folder correctly.

## How to choose an Open-Source Project

* After you have found the project you want to contribute to, it's time to do a little vetting. Make sure it meets the following criteria so you know it'll be a good project to work on:
    1. Checko out if it has a license file.
    2. Check when the last commit was made. This will help you know if the maintainers are active and also give you an estimate on how long it will take to respond to your contribution.
    3. Look for the number of contributors.
    4. Check how often people make commits.
