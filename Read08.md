# Alternative
## WET
The opposing view to DRY is called WET, commonly taken to stand for "write everything twice"
## AHA 
Another approach to abstractions is the AHA principle. AHA stands for "avoid hasty abstractions".  
AHA is rooted in the understanding that the deeper the investment we've made into abstracting a piece of software, the more we perceive that the cost of that investment can never be recovered  
# Rule of three (computer programming)
 is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication. It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.

# You aren't gonna need it
that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.
# Minimum viable product
A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development
