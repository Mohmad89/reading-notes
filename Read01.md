## Java Basic Reading Notes
In these Resources we learn about :  
### 1. Variables  
    we use variables to store value inside it  
    - data typy for any variables   
        1- long / int / double / short / byte  
        2- char / string / boolean  
    - Variables Name :  
        1- must start just whit character 
        2- the variable name dosen't contain any symply either " $ , _ "  
        3- variable contain number but after start character  
        4- Never contain spaces between words if you want to seperate   
           between tow words you must use _ sumpole 
### 2. Operators  
    is a special symbols we use it to perform specific operation on operands.
    - Type of operators  
        1. Mathematical operators.  
            (+ , - , * , ^ , / , %)   
        2. Logical operators  
            (&& , ||)  
        3. Relational operators  
            (> , < , <= , >= , == , !=)  
        4. Assignment Operators  
            (+= , -= , *= , /= )
### 3. Expressions  
    the expression is proccess thea we do it to foind aresulte .  
    Ex :  
      int a = 2 * 3 * 5 ;  
### 4. Statements  
    every line end with semicolon (;) we calld it Statement;
    Ex:  
        int i = 0;
        system.out.print("");
### 5. Bloks 
    is carly brackets that find inside it zero or more statements.  
    Ex : 
    if (n > 40) { 
        system.out.println ("is grater");
        n++;
    }
### 5. Control Flow Stetments  
    control with run way for our programme with use some statments (break , then , if , for , while , do-while, continue ).
