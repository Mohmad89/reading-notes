# Graphs 

* A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges

* Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs: 
    1. Vertix (Node) : is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
    2. Edge : connection between node.
    3. Neighbor  : The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
    4. Degree : number of Edge.

# Directed vs Undirected 

* Undirected Graph :is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional ( ---- )
* Directed (Digraph ) : is a graph where every edge is directed. ( ---> )

# Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected 

* Complete Graph : is evry nodes are connected to all other node .
* Connected : evrt node in graph has at least one edge .
* Disconnected : some node may not have edges .

# Acyclic vs Cyclic

* Acyclic Graph : Directe graph without cycles .
* Cyclic Graphs : graph has cycle (graph that start and end at the same vertix(node)).

# Graph Representation

1. Adjacency Matrix : we use the metrix to represent it wiht use 2-dimensional array with put 0 if there's not any edge between node and 1 if there's edge between node.

2. Adjacency List : An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

## Weighted Graphs 

* A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights. This is what a weighted graph looks like:
* we can assigne the weighte from 2D Array.

## Traversals

* You will be required to traverse through a graph. The traversals itself are like those of trees. Below is a breakdown of how you would traverse a graph.

1. Breadth First : In a breadth first traversal, you are starting at a specific vertex/node. This node must be specified when calling the BreadthFirst() method.

* Here is what the algorithm breadth first traversal looks like: 
    1. Enqueue the declared start node into the Queue.
    2. Create a loop that will run while the node still has nodes present.
    3. Dequeue the first node from the queue
    4. if the Dequeueâ€˜d node has unvisited child nodes, add the unvisited children to visited set and insert them into the queue.

2. Depth First : use the stack to push() the root after that will pop() the root then push() all child for this root.

## Real World Uses of Graphs

1. GPS and Mapping 
2. Driing Directions 
3. Social Networks
4. Airline Traffic
5. Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products .
