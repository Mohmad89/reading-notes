# Loops In Java

## First : for loop 
A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain     operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.  

Ex : I want to print "Hello" four times :   
    for (int i = 0; i < 4 ; i++)  
    {  
        System.out.println("Hello");  
    }    
## Second : While loop  
It repeat statements while the condetions is true  
Ex :  
    int i = 0;  
    while (i < 4){  
        System.out.println("Hello");  
        i++;  
    }  
## Third : Do-While loop  
The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.  
Ex :   
    int i = 0;    
    do{  
        System.out.println("Hello");  
        i++;  
    }while(i < 4);
